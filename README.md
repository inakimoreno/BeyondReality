# BeyondReality
BabylonJS won't work unless you run it on a server.

Go to your computer's terminal or command prompt and change directory to BeyondReality.
Once you have the folder open, type in "python3 -m http.server"
Then open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8000/

If there are any issues getting the server to work then go to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server and follow the instructions there.
